Automated Assignment.
Teachers usually give a set of 5 questions as assignment to whole class

These 5 question's solutions are shared among all the students, thus they learn nothing!

So, here each student can contribute to a pile of questions

On clicking your assigned assignments randomly 5 questions not made by that student are picked and assigned to him/her for this semester subject

Since the number of questions are large so no more cheating

Also student may ask the creator of the questions for their doubts, who himself is a student, so more learning and interactions among students
